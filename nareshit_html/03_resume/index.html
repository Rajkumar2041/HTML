                <p><h4><u>Project1: Drop Foot Stimulation</u></h4></p>
                <p>Drop foot stimulation refers to a therapeutic technique using electrical impulses to address the condition of drop foot, a gait abnormality. This innovative approach involves placing electrodes on specific muscles, stimulating controlled contraction, and facilitating improved foot dorsiflexion during walking. By activating the nerves responsible for lifting the foot, drop foot stimulation enhances mobility and reduces the risk of stumbling.</p>

                <p><h4><u>Project2: Obstacle Detection And Avoidance in Quadcopter-Based Drone System Using HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor</u></h4></p>
                <p>A prototype was built and offline online assessments were conducted. Prototype was built by using 4 propellers; an arduino module was inserted to process avoidance schema. Six ultrasonic sensors were employed to detect obstacle presence and fuzzy based algorithm determined the drone decision to surroundings. Assessment was mainly conducted to determine distance sensor performances. Study revealed that sensor installations should be far enough from the propellers as noises disrupted ultrasonic sensors. Offline test shows small error on measured distance, while online test shows higher error. Further solution is required to maintain distance measurement error low.</p>
